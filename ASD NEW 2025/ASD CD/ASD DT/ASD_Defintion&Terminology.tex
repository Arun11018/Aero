		 }}& \multirow{2}{*}{CO 5} \\\cline{2-2}
		&Dynamic aeroelasticity is concerned with the oscillatory effects of the aeroelastic interactions . This instability involves two or more modes of vibration and arises from the unfavourable coupling of aerodynamic, inertial and elastic forces
		 &\\\hline
		5&	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{What is wing divergence?
		}} & \multirow{2}{*}{CO 5} \\\cline{2-2}
		&	"phenomenon that occurs when the moments due to aerodynamic forces overcome the restoring moments
		due to structural stiffness, so resulting in structural failure"
		 &\\\hline
		6&	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{What is aileron control reversal?
		}} & \multirow{2}{*}{CO 5} \\\cline{2-2}
		&"A static aeroelastic instability occurring in wings with ailerons in flight, at a speed called
		the control reversal speed. At this speed the ailerons reverse their usual functionality (i.e.,
		the rolling direction associated with the given aileron moment is reversed."
		&\\\hline
		7&	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{What is buffeting?
		}} & \multirow{2}{*}{CO 5} \\\cline{2-2}
		&Buffeting is a high-frequency instability. It is caused by airflow separation or shock wave oscillations. It is a random forced vibration. Generally, it affects the tail unit of the aircraft structure due to the air flow downstream of the wing.

		8&	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{Define Torsional divergence phenomena.}} & \multirow{2}{*}{CO 5} \\\cline{2-2}
		&	A major factor in the predominance of the biplane design until the early 1930s when “stressed skin” metallic structural configurations were introduced to provide adequate torsional stiffness form on planes. &\\\hline
		9&	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{Outline the concept of flutter}} & \multirow{2}{*}{CO 5} \\\cline{2-2}
		&	Flutter is a self-feeding and potentially
		destructive vibration where aerodynamic
		forces on an object couple with a structure's
		natural mode of vibration to produce rapid
		periodic motion. &\\\hline
		10&	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{Summarize Collar triangle of forces.
		}} & \multirow{2}{*}{CO 5} \\\cline{2-2}
		&Collar has classified problems in Aeroelasticity by means of a triangle of three types of forces aerodynamic,elastic and inertia, represented by the symbols A, E and I are placed at the vertices of a triangle. Each aeroelastic phenomenon can be located on thediagram according to its relation to the three vertices.

		 	12&	\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{What is dynamic response of an aircraft?
		 		 }} & \multirow{2}{*}{CO 5} \\\cline{2-2}
		 & Transient response of aircraft structural components  produced by suddenly applied loads due to gusts, landing,gun reactions, abrupt control motions, moving shock waves,or other dynamic loads.
